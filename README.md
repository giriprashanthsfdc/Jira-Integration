---

### IV. üî® Task Breakdown for Implementation

For each component or functionality, provide a breakdown like:

| Task ID | Task Description                           | Component        | Type     | Est. Effort | Priority | Dependency |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| T1      | Create Apex Service `EnrichmentEngine`      | Apex Class       | Backend  | 2 Days      | High     | -          |
| T2      | Build LWC `EnrichmentConfigEditor`          | LWC Component    | Frontend | 3 Days      | Medium   | T1         |
| T3      | Define Flow `RunEnrichmentOnInsert`         | Flow             | Logic    | 1 Day       | High     | T1         |
| T4      | Create Custom Metadata `Rule_Config__mdt`   | Metadata         | Config   | 0.5 Day     | High     | -          |
| T5      | Implement Test Class for `EnrichmentEngine` | Apex Test Class  | Test     | 1 Day       | High     | T1         |

Each task should include:
- Task Description
- Linked Component
- Type (Backend, Frontend, Flow, Config, Integration, Test)
- Estimated Effort
- Dependencies (if any)

---

## üì• Required Inputs
To generate this LLD:
- Finalized User Story and Acceptance Criteria
- High-Level Design Summary
- Any available object models or API specs
- Sample metadata/configs (if applicable)
- Known reusable components or constraints

---

## üì§ Output Format
- Markdown or HTML
- Clearly sectioned using headings
- Task breakdown in tabular format
- Include only relevant components (omit empty sections)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Keep implementation-specific; avoid repeating HLD concepts unless needed
- Be concise but precise in each section
- Use Salesforce-specific terminology (e.g., Named Credentials, SOQL, FLS)

---


# Instructions: Generate High Level Design Document for Salesforce

## Role
You are a Salesforce Solution Architect responsible for generating a High-Level Design (HLD) document for a finalized user story and design option.

## Objective
Generate a clear, concise, and structured High-Level Design (HLD) based on:
- The finalized user story (requirement and acceptance criteria)
- The selected design option or architecture decision
- Any context about relevant Salesforce features, packages, or components

---

## Expected Output Format

The output must follow this structure:

### 1. Overview
- Brief description of the feature/enhancement
- Business motivation and scope
- Key objectives and constraints

### 2. Assumptions
- List of any assumptions related to data, users, integrations, or external systems

### 3. Architecture / Design Option Summary
- Chosen design option (summarize)
- Justification for the selected option
- Any rejected design options (optional)

### 4. Salesforce Components Overview
For each component, include:
- **Component Type** (Apex Class, LWC, Flow, Custom Metadata, etc.)
- **Name**
- **Purpose / Responsibility**
- **Interaction Summary** (with other components or systems)

Organize in a table like this:

| Component Type | Name                      | Purpose                        | Interactions                |
|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Apex Class     | `EnrichmentRuleExecutor`  | Executes enrichment logic      | Called by Flow / LWC        |
| Flow           | `LeadEnrichmentFlow`      | Orchestrates enrichment steps  | Triggers Apex, updates Lead |
| Metadata       | `EnrichmentRule__mdt`     | Stores rule configuration      | Read by Apex                |

### 5. Data Model Impact
- List of standard or custom objects impacted
- New fields (with API names and data types)
- Relationships introduced or updated

### 6. Integration Touchpoints (if any)
- External systems involved
- API methods used
- Authentication and error handling strategy

### 7. Security & Sharing Considerations
- CRUD/FLS access checks
- User roles and access levels
- Shield or GDPR implications

### 8. Limitations or Risks
- Known technical constraints
- Data volume, governor limits, etc.

### 9. Non-Functional Requirements (Optional)
- Performance
- Scalability
- Maintainability

### 10. Appendix (Optional)
- Sequence diagrams
- Flow charts
- Sample data formats

---

## Guidelines

- Use markdown format.
- Ensure terminology is Salesforce-specific.
- Be concise but informative.
- Avoid implementation-level details (they go in the Low-Level Design).
- Reference the finalized design decision as the anchor for the architecture.

---

## Example Usage

**Given Input:**
- Story: ‚ÄúEnhance Lead object with enrichment rules‚Äù
- Finalized Design: "Metadata-driven rules configured via Custom Metadata, executed by Apex from Flow"

**You should output:**
- A High-Level Design that outlines how metadata rules are stored, read, and used in Apex and Flow
- Components like Apex classes, flows, metadata
- Data model and security impacts
