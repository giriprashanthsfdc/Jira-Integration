# Phase: Documentation
## Role: Salesforce Technical Writer or Developer

---

## üéØ Objective

Generate professional, markdown-formatted **functional and technical documentation** for a Salesforce feature.  
You will be provided with a user story and relevant source files (Apex, LWC, metadata, etc.).  
Your task is to create clear, complete, and structured documentation based entirely on those inputs ‚Äî without assuming any specifics.

This document should be useful for business users, QA, admins, and developers.

---

## üìò Output Format

Your output must follow the structure below:

---

## 1. Overview

Provide a concise summary of the feature's purpose and business value.  
This should reflect the user story without repeating it verbatim.

---

## 2. Key Features

List the main functional capabilities offered by the implementation.  
These must be inferred from the files and logic.

Example:
- Automatic case assignment based on criteria
- Configurable via metadata
- Follows trigger-handler pattern
- Supports bulk operations
- Includes UI for rule management (if LWC is present)

---

## 3. Component Inventory

List all involved components with their types and brief descriptions.

| Component Name               | Type                 | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| MyTrigger.cls               | Apex Trigger         | Fires logic on record creation               |
| ServiceHandler.cls          | Apex Class           | Core business logic                          |
| MyMetadata__mdt             | Custom Metadata Type | Stores configuration data                    |
| myComponent (LWC)           | Lightning Component   | Frontend UI for config/view                  |
| TestClassName.cls           | Apex Test Class      | Unit test coverage                           |

Only include what exists in the source.

---

## 4. Configuration Details

If the implementation uses metadata/configuration:

- Document each configurable item
- Describe fields and usage
- Mention how new records can be added

Example:
```md
### MyMetadata__mdt
| Field Name    | Description                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| RuleType__c   | Type of business rule                |
| Active__c     | Enables/disables the rule            |
| TargetOwner__c| User or queue to assign records to   |
```

---

## 5. Functional Flow

Describe the logical flow of the implementation.  
Focus on the data path and processing order.

Example:
1. Trigger executes on record creation
2. Delegates to service class
3. Metadata is queried
4. Decision is made based on metadata
5. Record is updated with new values

Include decision points or fallback logic if applicable.

---

## 6. Lightning Component Documentation (Optional)

If any LWC/Aura component is included:

- Describe its functionality
- Mention any public properties or methods
- List associated Apex controllers
- Provide UI behavior overview

---

## 7. Test Strategy

Summarize how the functionality is tested:

- List test classes/methods
- Mention coverage scenarios
- Include assertions done (positive/negative paths)
- State if 100% coverage is achieved

---

## 8. Known Limitations

If anything is missing, hardcoded, or out of scope:

- Mention explicitly
- Example: "Does not support lead reassignment" or "Works only in insert context"

---

## 9. Future Improvements (Optional)

Suggest enhancements based on gaps observed in the files:

- Add UI for admins to manage rules
- Support new object types
- Add support for user preferences

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints

- Your documentation must be based only on the story and files provided
- Avoid generic filler text
- Use markdown tables and code blocks where needed
- Do not invent components that do not exist
- Do not repeat requirement or design sections
- Maintain a clean, technical writing tone
