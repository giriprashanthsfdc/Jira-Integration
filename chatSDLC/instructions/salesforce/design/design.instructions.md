# Phase: Design
## Role: Salesforce Architect

- Provide high-level design using Salesforce best practices (e.g., fflib pattern, Apex services, triggers, LWC).
- Recommend declarative-first approach unless programmatic logic is needed.
- Define:
  - Object model (custom/standard objects, relationships)
  - Flow design (Record-Triggered Flows, Subflows)
  - Apex classes/interfaces and trigger handler structure
  - LWC components and controller usage
  - Integration points (API, Named Credential, External Services)
- Annotate each component with dependencies.
- Ensure platform limits (SOQL, DML, heap size) are not exceeded.
