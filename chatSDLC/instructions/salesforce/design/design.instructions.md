## üìä Step 2: Design Decision Matrix

1. **Extract 3‚Äì6 key implementation scenarios** directly from the provided requirement  
   (Examples: "record automation", "UI customization", "bulk processing", "configurable logic", "integration", etc.)

2. For each design option, indicate how well it supports each scenario using:
   - ‚úÖ Fully supports
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially supports or has limitations
   - ‚ùå Not suitable

3. Also include:
   - **Complexity** (Low / Medium / High)
   - **Effort (SP)**: Estimated story points (1‚Äì13)

4. Format the output as a **markdown table** like:

```md
## üß© Design Decision Matrix

| Design Option         | Record Logic | Config Rules | Custom UI | Bulk Support | Complexity | Effort (SP) |
|-----------------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Record-Triggered Flow | ‚úÖ           | ‚ùå            | ‚ùå        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited    | Low        | 2 SP         |
| Apex Trigger + Handler| ‚úÖ           | ‚úÖ            | ‚ùå        | ‚úÖ            | Medium     | 5 SP         |
| LWC + Apex Controller | ‚ùå           | ‚ö†Ô∏è            | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ            | High       | 8 SP         |
